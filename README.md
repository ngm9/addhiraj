# 🎥 ADDhiraj

ADDhiraj is a revolutionary tool designed to empower individuals with Attention Deficit Disorders like ADD and ADHD in their educational journey. ADDhiraj addresses a critical challenge faced by millions worldwide—learning through videos.

For many of us with ADD and ADHD, traditional video formats often prove overwhelming and ineffective. We struggle to maintain focus, retain information, and manage the complexities of longer content. Recognizing these barriers firsthand, we set out to create ADDhiraj—a platform that not only enhances accessibility but transforms how neurodiverse individuals engage with educational videos.

## ✨ Key Features

- **📚 Segmentation and Highlighting:**
  - Automatically divides lengthy videos into concise 1-2 minute clips, highlighting key concepts for optimal comprehension.
  
- **🔧 Customizable Accessibility Features:**
  - **⏲️ Timestamp Markers:** Navigate through videos easily with timestamped markers.
  - **🔊 Audio Customization Controls:** Adjust audio elements like background noise and voice amplification.
  - **📝 Multimedia Annotations:** Enhance learning with text, sounds, and images linked to specific video moments.
  - **🎨 Visual Adjustment Tools:** Reduce distractions by editing visual elements without altering the core content.

- **🎓 Interactive Learning Tools:**
  - **🃏 Flashcards and MCQs:** Reinforce learning through active recall and spaced repetition techniques.
  - **🔄 Dynamic Content Adaptation:** Tailor future content based on user interactions and feedback.

## 🌟 Why ADDhiraj?

In the world, 139.8 million or 3% of the population suffer from ADD and ADHD. As a person with ADD and ADHD who is currently in the education system, videos pose a significant challenge. They are often longer than 15 minutes, leading to distractions and requiring multiple repetitions to comprehend the material. ADDhiraj incorporates strategies like Distraction Reduced Environments, Micro Learning, and Repetition to give agency to our neurodiverse brothers and sisters.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **✂️ Video Segmentation:** ADDhiraj takes in all forms of videos and cuts them into 1-2 minute clips, creating a highlight reel of key points.
2. **🧠 Interactive Learning:** After watching each segment, users are prompted with flashcards and MCQs to reinforce understanding through active recall and spaced repetition.
3. **📈 Dynamic Adaptation:** Using user responses and questions, the platform creates a new set of videos tailored to the user's needs, focusing on areas that require more attention.
